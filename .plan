G¹G²ved ops
=================================

edator ideas:

shift-del toggle click-delete mode
ctrl-h toggle clcik item replace modes
rubber-band ops will also del

rubber-band ops - click and drag will expand to set region of place / del / edit
- some modes will auto operate
- idea: show rubber band with visible indicator smh (sprites?)
* ctrl-click should only outline
- copy, cut & paste rubber-band contents, wip

replace mode - either over entire maze, rubber band region, select y/n on each find, or click item replace

some type of quick-key insert system, maybe shifted # or so
* possibly assignable hot-keys
- more default hotkeys

a palette system similar to edit in sanctuary
- and the edit options dialog
- put palette into sd buffer 0, which isnt normally selectable
- bring up on home key
- the palette will be editable, but save will need to be diff (autosave when swap palette out?)
  or a second window for palette, with edit opts

a basic "playable" mode to test mazes
- no h/s, multiplay, thief, mugger, diff move monsters, treasure rooms, secret rooms, dragons, etc
- sprites needed (sprites have to replace gens, treasure, keys, pots, etc)

multiple save buffers to store vars maze edits, page thru all wiht 'S', store with #'S', load with #'L'
* have to be in edit mode to load
* can always store & page -- g1 & g2 have sep buffers
- save to disk on set, load up on launch  for all sd files found
- use a certain buffer (0 ?) to store the main edit pallete for middl-clicks
* modify lod_maz to pass mazedata & bool for ubuf
* dirty flag so quit, z, x know unsaved changes are there and give warning dialog
- list of delbuf overview, contents, etc somehow

think about retooling buffer file read to work like rom reader in roms.go instead of ioutil.ReadFile(fil)

issues needing fixed

perhaps needs rewrite:
- cleanup kontrol
  move some sd buf ops to edat ?
