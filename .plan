G¹G²ved ops
=================================

edator ideas:

shift-del toggle click-delete mode
rubber-band ops will also del

rubber-band ops - click and drag will expand to set region of place / del / edit
- some modes will auto operates

replace mode - either over entire maze, rubber band region, select y/n on each find, or click item replace

some type of quick-key insert system, maybe shifted # or so
- possibly assignable hot-keys

a palette system similar to edit in sanctuary
- and the edit options dialog

a basic "playable" mode to test mazes
- no h/s, multiplay, thief, mugger, diff move monsters, treasure rooms, secret rooms, dragons, etc
