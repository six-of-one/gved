G¹G²ved ops
=================================

edator ideas:

shift-del toggle click-delete mode
ctrl-h toggle clcik item replace modes
rubber-band ops will also del

drag mouse while key held - do line of setcode

rubber-band ops - click and drag will expand to set region of place / del / edit
- some modes will auto operate

replace mode - either over entire maze, rubber band region, select y/n on each find, or click item replace

some type of quick-key insert system, maybe shifted # or so
* possibly assignable hot-keys
- more default hotkeys

a palette system similar to edit in sanctuary
- and the edit options dialog

a basic "playable" mode to test mazes
- no h/s, multiplay, thief, mugger, diff move monsters, treasure rooms, secret rooms, dragons, etc

multiple save buffers to store vars maze edits, page thru all wiht 'S', store with #'S', load with #'L'
- have to be in edit mode to load
- can always store & page
- save to disk on set, load up on launch  for all sd files found
* modify lod_maz to pass mazedata & bool for ubuf
- dirty flag so quit, z, x know unsaved changes are there and give warning dialog

think about retooling buffer file read to work like rom reader in roms.go instead of ioutil.ReadFile(fil)
