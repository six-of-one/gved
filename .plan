G¹G²ved ops
=================================

edator ideas:

ctrl-h toggle clcik item replace modes

rubber-band ops - click and drag will expand to set region of place / del / edit
- idea: show rubber band with visible indicator smh (sprites?)
* ctrl-click should only operate with outer cells
* copy, cut & paste rubber-band contents

replace mode - either over entire maze, rubber band region, select y/n on each find, or click item replace
\_ possibly also use #T mask for allowing edits on elements, or disallow

some type of quick-key insert system, maybe shifted # or so
* possibly assignable hot-keys
* more default hotkeys

a palette system similar to edit in sanctuary
- and the edit options dialog
* put palette into sd buffer 0, which isnt normally selectable
* bring up on home key
* or a second window for palette, with edit opts

a basic "playable" mode to test mazes
- no h/s, multiplay, thief, mugger, diff move monsters, treasure rooms, secret rooms, dragons, etc
- sprites needed (sprites have to replace gens, treasure, keys, pots, etc)
- port rnd load profile sanctuary code, and use #T flags to remove certain elements

multiple save buffers to store vars maze edits, page thru all wiht 'S', store with #'S', load with #'L'
* can always store & page -- g1 & g2 have sep buffers
* use a certain buffer (0 ?) to store the main edit pallete for middl-clicks
* modify lod_maz to pass mazedata & bool for ubuf
* dirty flag so quit, pgup, pgdn know unsaved changes are there and give warning dialog
- list of delbuf overview, contents, etc somehow

copy / cut / paste
* do same with ccp buffer - page thru and view them
* for now these lock in - this is a 'feature' (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) until proper cfg file & dialog allow selection
* using new window to view paste buffer contents

issues needing fixed
- will the autosaves (around L, S, etc) become an issue?
- undo after paste works weirdly sometimes
- saw instanced where paste pasted wrong data, needs checked again

possible:
- down the line .ed stored maz# could be used to set maz num
- dialog for setting / reading bits of #T hide mask and #flg blank maze keep mask
- way using sprites to demo half transparent paste content over maze
think about retooling buffer file read to work like rom reader in roms.go instead of ioutil.ReadFile(fil)

perhaps needs rewrite:
- cleanup all modules
\_ look at more code that can be fn() calls to reduce heavy repeats
 \_ code around paste buf save & load
  \_ all the buffer xfer code (main issue struct of slices doesnt parm pass easy)

removed:
ӿ add element totals to palette window      (doesnt work consistently on window update...)
ӿ shift-del toggle click-delete mode
  (this is the same as sticky cut mode, except that saves cut areas in pastebuf)
