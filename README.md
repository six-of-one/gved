G¹G²ved
=======

- visual editor for gauntlet, gauntlet 2 mazes
    (and eventually sanctuary...)
- interactive mode still needs code moved out of terminal ops gotilengine display
- had issues with gotilengine.TLN_DrawFrame(0) only wanting to draw 2 or 3 mazes
- right now the only interactive cmd is 'Q' for quit

command line suggestions:
* gved -i maze115
    (interactive system)
* gved -g2 -v ma
    (view output.png)
* gved floor0
    (view output.png)

Issues
======
* still only a viewer
* possible to crash with valid parms
