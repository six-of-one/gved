interactive system:			(on command line enter:./gved -i)
------------------

the menu bar lists key commands available, which mode is active
and various edit status details

the program title shows maze #, maze address and buffer # when one is loaded
- when switching G¹ / G² it will also list that with G¹ revision

general controls:			(general keys are always available in both modes)
----------------

<CTRL>-Q	quit program

?			command key hints dialog

#a	load maze #
	(G¹ valid 1-127, G² valid 1-117)
A	enable address mode (experimental, likely to never work with arcade emu)
	- load a maze from ANY address that will not crash the engine (address list at end of constants.go)
	- when enabled #a will load any valid address in decimal 229376 - 262143
	- z, x will also cycle -, + to the next *valid* address

- note: A mode was used to discover address that would decode G¹ mazes
		the engine was never intended to read maze data this way


two op modes exist, view only and edit

<ESC>	turn edit mode on - initializes current maze to disk in .ed if not present
<ESC>	turn edit off/ view back on and check for unsaved data

S	cycle through all save data buffers in .ed/sd#####_g?.ed	(where g? is g1 or g2)
	- while cycling any edits to current maze are saved temporary as .ed/ebuf.ed
	- buffer edits will also auto save (including std maze ones)
	- limit is currently 999 buffers
#L	load buffer #####											(current limit 999 bufs)
#S	save current visible maze as buffer #####
	- while sd buffers are available in view mode, no view mode changes (fgwqhmrR) will be saved

pgup 	previous maze		or		previous sd buf
pgdn	next maze					next sd buf
									- when sd view is active, pgup stops at 1
									- pgdn will exit to mazes on last buf

View mazes only:		( and cmd keys in edit )
---------------

i	gauntlet mazes G¹ rev 1-9
l	gauntlet mazes G¹ rev 14
u	gauntlet 2 mazes G² all

v	list G¹ or G² maze address set to terminal where gved was launched


these keys are temporary in view mode and edit the buffer in edit mode
- with edit off, these will not operate on sd buf mazes

f,F	 + or - floor pattern in cycle of all patterns
g,G	 + or - floor colors in cycle of all colors
w,W	 + or - wall pattern in cycle
q,Q	 + or - wall colors in cycle
#	and #f, #g, #w, #q - set valid pattern / color #, with invalid going to 0

h	horizontally mirror the maze (G¹ does this after many levels, G² from maze 1)
m	vertically mirror "flip" the maze (same G¹ / G² note)
	- doing both rotates maze 180°
r	[ sanctuary only! ] rotate maze +90°
R	[ sanctuary only! ] rotate maze -90°
	- gauntlet arcade does NOT do this
	- this is a feature of the sanctuary port only
t	set rotate to 0°	(not available in edit mode!)

following keys are visible effect only, no edit changes are made

s	display random "special potions" and gold bags on emply floor tiles
L	toggle generator indicator letters [ DGLS ] showing what a box gen produces
p	toggle floor invisible *
P	toggle walls invisible *
T	loop through a set of invisible flags or, *
#T	set invisible flag set - hide vars maze elements: *
	NOGEN = 1		// all generators
	NOMON = 2		// all monster, dragon
	NOFUD = 4		// all food
	NOTRS = 8		// treas, locked
	NOPOT = 16		// pots & t.powers
	NODOR = 32		// doors, keys
	NOTRAP = 64		// trap & floor dots, stun, ff tiles
	NOEXP = 128		// exit, push wall
	NOTHN = 256		// anything else left
	NOFLOOR = 512
	NOWALL = 1024
	NOG1W = 2048		// g1 std wall only
- these are hidden only and still present in maze			(* disabled when edit keys active)

Edit mazes:
----------

in edit mode with cmd keys set, many of the view mode keys are still functional
- fF, gG, wW, qQ, h, m, rR however, all cause edit buffer changes

edit mode stores changes in buffer files in subdir .ed
there is as yet no way, *with gved*, to recompress and store mazes in rom...

most of these have a corresponging item on edit or file menus

<SH-CTRL>-S	save current buffer for maze to disk as a generic buffer save
			- typing a # first will pre-pend that as the mazes #
			  (it does not cause it to load that # for now)
<SH-CTRL>-L	load generic buffer save from disk into edit buffer
			- these are NOT compatible with below, doing a <CTRL>-S after a 
			  generic load WILL overwrite the buffer for current maze #

<CTRL>-S	save edit buffer for maze # to disk as a maze edit buffer for maze#
			- A (address) mode will NOT save edit buffer for address, it will save to current maze #
<CTRL>-L	load edit buffer from disk from buffer for maze#
<CTRL>-R	reset edit buffer for current maze # from rom
			- these are also on the edit menu

<CTRL>-C	set for copy contents of next Left-click mouse drag
<CTRL>-X	set for cut contents of next Left-click mouse drag - floor will be set
<CTRL>-P	paste contents of c/c/p buffer at Left-click location
			- c/c/p are 'sticky', they stay on, select again to turn off, or select another edit action

<SH-CTRL>-P	roll thru session paste buffer, loading each one
<SH-CTRL>-O	roll thru master paste buffer, loading each one
			- auto switching G¹ to G²

when pb window is selected:
, or O		(,< key) master paste buffer --
. or P		(.> key) master paste buffer ++
o			session paste buffer --
p			session paste buffer ++
q,Q			close subwindow		(also pal window)

<CTRL>-Z	undo last op - currently holds {all mem until its unworkable} units (single maze cell) of undo
<CTRL>-Y	redo last undo up to last change entered
			-undo back 5 or 10 and place a new item and the forward chain is lost
<CTRL>-U	when the maze is loaded from disk an ulternate buffer is stored and ctrl-U swaps them
			- both can be edited, but both can not yet be saved

<HOME>		toggle a complete item palette for G¹ / G²
			- middle click on item with edit active, valid key selected
			- palette for G¹ / G² in subwindow (position is not code controlled, you have to drag it)
			- auto switching G¹ to G²

certain ops will check for unsaved changes and launch a dialog to save
(pgup, pgdn, a, <ESC>, i, l, u, ctrl-q )

\	toggle cmd keys and edit keys		(only while in edit mode)

c,C	cycle -,+ maze element on this edit key, looping over 1 - 64, and activate key for placement
	- 'c' can be still assigned any value, 'C' can not be assigned
#c	assign cycle key to #, in range of 1 - 64

H	toggle horizontal wrap - Y column = 32 will be removed/ restored (will restore on toggle with contents intact until saved)
M	toggle vertical wrap   - X row = 32 will likewise be removed/ restored

Mouse operation
---------------

Left-click		place current edit key item in maze at cursor
Middle-click	assign item at cursor to current edit key (will NOT assign floor)

Left-click drag	- dragging to new location - fill / delete the encompassed rectangle

key held with Left-click

delete			both place a floor at cursor

control			when dragging mouse, box will fill / delete an outline only

** EDIT KEYS **
---------------
edit keys are item placement reassignable keys

hit <ESC> to edit mazes
hit '\' to activate / deactivate edit keys		(when not in edit keys, cmd keys from view mode are active)

press a key, the item assigned to that key will be placed in the maze with a Left-click mouse button
- while a key is active, middle-click mouse button on any maze item re-assigns that key to that item

- edit status will indicate when a key is selected or assigned, and what it places


these are pre-defined for G¹ / G², and re-assignable:

d	horiz door
D	vert door
w	normal walls
W	shootable walls
q	trap wall (needs trap tile)
r	trap tile to release walls
f	food, shootable
F	food, non shootable
p	potion, shootable
P	potion, non shootable
k	key
i - invisible power
x - exit
z - Death
t	treasure
T	teleporter

G¹ extra

b	bag treasure
g	lvl 3 ghost
G	lvl 3 grunt
h	lvl 2 grun gen
l	lvl 2 lobber gen
n	lvl 3 ghost gen
m	lvl 2 demon gen

G² extra

b	forcefield hub
m	pushable wall
n	acid blob
o	super sorceror
R	random wall section
s	stun tile

any key in this grid without an * is an edit key

  30 =          !  "  #  $  %  &  '
  40 = (  )  *  +  ,  -  .  /  0  1
  50 = 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  :  ;
  60 = <  =  >  ?* @  A* B  C* D  E
  70 = F  G  H* I  J  K  L* M  N  O
  80 = P  Q  R  S* T  U  V* W  X  Y
  90 = Z  [  \* ]  ^  _  `  a* b  c
 100 = d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k  l  m
 110 = n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w
 120 = x  y  z  {  |  }  ~

these are system reserved keys and can NOT be reassigned
?, \, C, aA, L, S, H, V

Menu operations
---------------

additional not covered above:

Quit		- seems to be a default on 1st menu, and does NOT check for edit changes
Exit		- use this, it does a buffer check and pops up a save dialog

Load		- loads a maze from std file (not intended to be a buffer file from .ed)
Save		- saves a maze to a std file, if # is set on title numeric: store that as maze #
				(maze numbers in files not currently used)

Blank		- fill buffer with blank maze, default floors & walls (must be in edit mode, can also use # keep)
Blank keep	- blank maze, but keep current floors, walls, exit, starts, and -
			  if # is set on title numeric: use inversion of #T hide items mask to preserve those
