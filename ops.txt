interactive system (on command line enter:./gved -i)
------------------

general controls:			(general keys are always available in both modes)

<CTRL>-Q	quit program
- note: unsaved edits check fails

?			command key hints dialog

#a	load maze #
	(G¹ valid 1-127, G² valid 1-117)
A	enable address mode (experimental, likely to never work with arcade emu)
	- load a maze from ANY address that will not crash the engine (address list at end of constants.go)
	- when enabled #a will load any valid address in decimal 229376 - 262143

two op modes exist, view and edit

e	turn edit mode on - saves current maze to disk in .ed
E	turn edit off/ view back on and check for unsaved data

S	cycle through all save data buffers in .ed/sd#####_g?.ed	(where g? is g1 or g2)
	- while cycling any edits to current maze are saved temporary as .ed/ebuf.ed
#S	load buffer #####
#L	save current visible maze as buffer #####
	- while sd buffers are available in view mode, no view mode changes (fgwqhmrR) will be saved

view mazes only / cmd keys in edit:

i	gauntlet mazes G¹ rev 1-9
l	gauntlet mazes G¹ rev 14
u	gauntlet 2 mazes G² all

v	list G¹ or G² maze address set to terminal where gved was launched

z 	previous maze
x	next maze


these keys are temporary in view mode and edit the buffer in edit mode

f,F	 + or - floor pattern in cycle of all patterns
g,G	 + or - floor colors in cycle of all colors
w,W	 + or - wall pattern in cycle
q,Q	 + or - wall colors in cycle
#	any of f,g,w,q - set valid pattern / color #, with invalid going to 0

h	horizontally mirror the maze (G¹ does this after many levels, G² from maze 1)
m	vertically mirror "flip" the maze (same G¹ / G² note)
	- doing both rotates maze 180°
r	[ sanctuary only! ] rotate maze +90°
R	[ sanctuary only! ] rotate maze -90°
	- gauntlet arcade does NOT do this - this is a feature of the sanctuary port only
t	set rotate to 0°	(not available in edit mode!)

following keys are visible effect only, no edit changes are made

s	display random "special potions" and gold bags on emply floor tiles
L	toggle generator indicator letters [ DGLS ] showing what a box gen produces
p	toggle floor invisible
P	toggle walls invisible
T	loop through a set of invisible flags or,
#T	set invisible flag set - hide vars maze elements:
	NOGEN = 1		// all generators
	NOMON = 2		// all monster, dragon
	NOFUD = 4		// all food
	NOTRS = 8		// treas, locked
	NOPOT = 16		// pots & t.powers
	NODOR = 32		// doors, keys
	NOTRAP = 64		// trap & floor dots, stun, ff tiles
	NOEXP = 128		// exit, push wall
	NOTHN = 256		// anything else left
	NOFLOOR = 512
	NOWALL = 1024
	NOG1W = 2048		// g1 std wall only

edit mazes:

in edit mode with cmd keys set, many of the view mode keys are still functional
- fF, gG, wW, qQ, h, m, rR however, all cause edit buffer changes

edit mode stores changes in buffer files in .ed
there is as yet no way to recompress and store mazes in rom...

<CTRL>-S	save current buffer for maze # to disk
<CTRL>-L	load current buffer for maze # from disk
<CTRL>-R	reset buffer for current maze # from rom
			- these are also on the edit menu

certain ops will check for unsaved changes and launch a dialog to save
(z, x, a, #L, E)

\	toggle cmd keys and edit keys
